# containerized-bomb-disposal
Set of dockerfiles meant for throw-away instances that achieve a singular purpose: to "safely" interact (run, play, unzip, etc) with programs or files without the need of a full VM to avoid compromise of the host machine. Think of it as a bomb disposal device for files you don't trust that much but still need to run, unzip or play.
